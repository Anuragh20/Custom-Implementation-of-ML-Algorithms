# Custom-Implementation-of-ML-Algorithms

**Summary:**
This folder contains the custom implementation of various machine learning algorithms with the use of any of the popular libraries such as Scikit Learn etc.

**Objective of the Activity:**
To deconstruct the inner workings of a Machine Learning Algorithm in order to achieve the following:
1.	Understand the overall flow of the data during the Training Phase
2.	Evaluate the Space and Time complexity of the algorithm during the Training and the Testing phases
3.	Identify the Boundary cases of the algorithm and figure out the weakness, the areas where the algorithm could fail
4.	Better understand the actual math behind the inner workings
5.	Ability to recreate the algorithm in cases where the traditional libraries such as Scikit Learn fail to scale up when the size of the data set is huge
